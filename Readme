# LooCrew (aka "Sh*tMap")

Community-powered bathroom discovery and social journaling for the moments that matter most.

## Vision
Give people confidence to find (and share) great restrooms anywhere while keeping the experience lighthearted, respectful, and fun.

## Audience & Personas
- **Urban Explorer**: Moving around the city, wants quick access to clean, safe toilets near transit hubs.
- **Remote Worker**: Needs dependable restroom options between coffee shops and coworking spots.
- **Social Crew**: Friends who enjoy playful check-ins, badges, and inside jokes about their adventures.
- **Parent on the Go**: Values amenities like changing tables, family-friendly stalls, and clear access info.

## Core Use Cases
1. Locate a nearby restroom that meets specific preferences (cleanliness, accessibility, type, hours).
2. Contribute to community knowledge with ratings, reviews, photos, and details.
3. Share a humorous, opt-in check-in with friends and react together in a private feed.
4. Track personal restroom streaks, badges, and leaderboard placement for motivation.

## Experience Overview

### Map & Finder Flow
1. Home screen opens on a map centered around the user.
2. Filters surface stalls by cleanliness score, accessibility, type (mall, public, cafe), or open status.
3. Tapping a pin reveals a card with ratings, reviews, amenities (TP, soap, gender neutral), opening hours, and access instructions (paywall, key required).
4. From the card, users can navigate, bookmark, view photos, or contribute a new review.

### Check-in & Social Flow
1. Tap "Drop a Log" to select the restroom (from map or search).
2. Add a playful caption, optional photo (stall only), mood sticker, and privacy scope (friends-only, private log).
3. Post lands in the friends feed with reactions (lol, clutch save, sympathy) and comment thread.
4. Activity counts toward streaks, badges ("Mall Sh*tter"), and weekly leaderboards (e.g., "Most Consistent Logger").

## Feature Details

## Monetization & Growth
- Potential partnerships with cafes, coworking spaces, or gas stations for featured placement.
- Premium tier: ad-free experience, advanced filters (family rooms, bidets), offline maps.
- Sponsored badges or quests (e.g., "City Clean Freak" powered by a cleaning brand).
- Growth loops via referral rewards, streak sharing, and community challenges.

## MVP Scope (Phase 1)
- Map view with geolocation, restroom pins, basic filters (cleanliness, open now).
- Restroom detail view with community ratings, reviews, and access notes.
- Submit review with structured ratings and optional photo (moderated before publishing).
- Friends-only check-ins with captions and reactions (no comments to start).
- Basic gamification: streak counter and one leaderboard (weekly check-ins).
- Admin dashboard snippet for verifying new restroom submissions.

## Technical Notes
- Mobile-first (iOS + Android) using React Native or Flutter for shared UI; native modules for maps, location permissions, and push notifications.
- Backend with location-aware datastore (e.g., PostgreSQL + PostGIS or Firestore + Geo queries).
- Map provider: Mapbox or Google Maps SDK with custom pin rendering.
- Media storage and moderation: cloud storage (S3, Firebase Storage) plus third-party moderation APIs.
- Real-time features (feed updates, reactions) via WebSockets or managed services (Firebase RTDB, PubNub).
- Authentication: phone number or social login with two-factor option.

## Future Ideas
- Offline mode with cached toilets and user-created notes for spotty coverage.
- Accessibility-first mode highlighting stalls with wide doors, rails, or adult changing tables.
- Integration with transit apps or travel guides for tourism contexts.
- AR overlay to guide users to restrooms in large malls or venues.
- Brand collaborations for "Pop-up Relief Stations" at events.

## Open Questions
- What level of anonymity do users want when sharing check-ins?
- How do we balance playful tone with respectful language in public spaces?
- What incentives best encourage high-quality, honest reviews without spam?
- Should we allow global discovery or keep the network mostly friends-only at launch?
